## About contentanalysis

**contentanalysis** is an R package designed to facilitate comprehensive analysis of scientific literature. It provides researchers with powerful tools to extract, analyze, and visualize content from PDF documents, with a particular focus on citation analysis and text mining.

## Key Features

### PDF Processing
- Multi-column layout support (1, 2, or 3 columns)
- Automatic section detection (Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, etc.)
- Structure preservation during text extraction
- Handles complex academic paper layouts

### Citation Analysis
- Detects multiple citation formats (narrative and parenthetical)
- Extracts citation contexts with configurable window sizes
- Automatic reference matching via CrossRef API
- Citation network visualization
- Co-citation analysis

### Text Analytics
- Word frequency analysis with stopword removal
- N-gram extraction (bigrams, trigrams, etc.)
- Word distribution tracking across document sections
- Readability metrics (Flesch Reading Ease, Flesch-Kincaid, etc.)
- Lexical diversity measures

### Visualization
- Interactive citation networks with visNetwork
- Word distribution plots (line, bar, area)
- Customizable color schemes and layouts
- Publication-ready figures

## Use Cases

The package is designed for:

- **Systematic Literature Reviews**: Analyze citation patterns and content across multiple papers
- **Bibliometric Studies**: Map citation networks and identify influential works
- **Content Analysis Research**: Extract and quantify themes, concepts, and terminology
- **Academic Writing Assessment**: Evaluate readability and citation practices
- **Research Methodology**: Study how citations are deployed in scientific arguments

## Version History

### Version 0.1.0 (Current)

Initial release featuring:

- PDF import with automatic section detection
- Comprehensive citation analysis
- CrossRef integration for reference matching
- Interactive network visualization
- Text analysis and n-gram extraction
- Readability metrics
- Word distribution tracking
- Batch processing capabilities

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Installation

**Q: How do I install the package?**

```r
devtools::install_github("massimoaria/contentanalysis")
```

**Q: What R version is required?**

R >= 4.0.0 is recommended.

### Usage

**Q: Can I analyze scanned PDFs?**

No, the package requires text-based PDFs. Scanned documents need OCR processing first.

**Q: Do I need a DOI for analysis?**

No, but providing a DOI enables automatic reference matching via CrossRef, which significantly improves citation-reference linking.

**Q: Is an internet connection required?**

Only if you use the CrossRef integration features. Local analysis works offline.

**Q: Can I analyze multiple papers at once?**

Yes! See the [Tutorial](tutorial.qmd) for batch processing examples.

### Technical

**Q: Why are some citations not detected?**

Citation detection works best with standard formats (APA, MLA, Chicago). Non-standard or poorly formatted citations may be missed.

**Q: How accurate is the section detection?**

Very accurate for standard academic papers with clear section headers. Custom keywords can be provided for non-standard formats.

**Q: Can I customize the network visualization?**

Yes, through the `max_distance`, `min_connections`, and `show_labels` parameters.

## Support

For support:

1. Check the [documentation](reference/)
2. Read the [tutorial](tutorial.qmd)
3. Search [existing issues](https://github.com/massimoaria/contentanalysis/issues)
4. Open a new issue if needed

## Roadmap

Planned features for future releases:

- Enhanced PDF layout detection
- Additional readability metrics
- Support for more citation styles
- Advanced network analysis metrics
