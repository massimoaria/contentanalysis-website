- **Automatic reference matching via CrossRef and OpenAlex** ðŸ†•
- **Improved matching algorithms with confidence scoring** ðŸ†•
- Citation network visualization
- Co-citation analysis

### Text Analytics
- Word frequency analysis with stopword removal
- N-gram extraction (bigrams, trigrams, etc.)
- Word distribution tracking across document sections
- Readability metrics (Flesch Reading Ease, Flesch-Kincaid, etc.)
- Lexical diversity measures

### Visualization
- Interactive citation networks with visNetwork
- Word distribution plots (line, bar, area)
- Customizable color schemes and layouts
- Publication-ready figures

## Use Cases

The package is designed for:

- **Systematic Literature Reviews**: Analyze citation patterns and content across multiple papers
- **Bibliometric Studies**: Map citation networks and identify influential works

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Installation

**Q: How do I install the package?**

```r
devtools::install_github("massimoaria/contentanalysis")
```

**Q: What R version is required?**

R >= 4.0.0 is recommended.

### Usage

**Q: Can I analyze scanned PDFs?**

The package primarily works with text-based PDFs. However, with the new AI-enhanced extraction feature (using Google Gemini), you may get better results with scanned or low-quality PDFs. For best results with scanned documents, use OCR processing first.

**Q: Do I need a DOI for analysis?**

No, but providing a DOI enables automatic reference matching via CrossRef and OpenAlex, which significantly improves citation-reference linking accuracy.

**Q: Is an internet connection required?**

Only if you use the CrossRef/OpenAlex integration features or AI-enhanced extraction. Local analysis works offline.

**Q: Can I analyze multiple papers at once?**

Yes! See the [Tutorial](tutorial.qmd) for batch processing examples.

### Technical

**Q: Why are some citations not detected?**

Citation detection works best with standard formats (APA, MLA, Chicago, Vancouver). The package now includes improved numeric citation recognition. Non-standard or poorly formatted citations may still be missed.

**Q: How accurate is the section detection?**

Very accurate for standard academic papers with clear section headers. Custom keywords can be provided for non-standard formats.

**Q: Can I customize the network visualization?**

Yes, through the `max_distance`, `min_connections`, and `show_labels` parameters.

**Q: How do I use the AI-enhanced extraction features?** ðŸ†•

Get a free API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) and set it as an environment variable:
```r
Sys.setenv(GEMINI_API_KEY = "your-api-key-here")
```
Then use `pdf2txt_auto()` with `use_ai = TRUE` or call `gemini_content_ai()` directly.

**Q: Do I need to pay for the Gemini API?** ðŸ†•

Google offers a free tier for the Gemini API with generous limits. Check [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/) for current pricing and limits.

## Support

For support:

1. Check the [documentation](reference/)
2. Read the [tutorial](tutorial.qmd)
3. Search [existing issues](https://github.com/massimoaria/contentanalysis/issues)
